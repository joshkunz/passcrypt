passcrypt
==========

Cryptographically secure password manager.

# What is it?
passcrypt has one very simple goal in mind. To be a drop dead
simple password manager that holds your passwords in a
secure encrypted file. I wrote it because I needed a way to keep
my passwords and authorization tokens secure yet public, the
only real way to do this is to encrypt them. There were some
similar looking programs, but most seemed out of date or
too large, hence this.

# Status
pass crypt is still in the early stages of development (getting the
encryption working) so don't try and actually use this for anything
yet.
